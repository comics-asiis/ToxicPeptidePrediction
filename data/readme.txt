This directory contains the original datasets and the benchmark dataset in fasta format.
The original datasets consists of original_positive_data.fasta and original_negative_data.fasta containing collected 4805 toxic peptide sequences and 7107 non-toxic peptide sequences, respectively.
The benchmark dataset, benchmark_data.fasta, is generated by merging the positive and negative sequences in the original datasets and filtering out sequences with at least 90% similarity, resulting in 8808 sequences in total.
