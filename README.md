# ToxTeller
ToxTeller is a toxicity prediction tool for peptides with length 10-50 amino acids. 

It provides four predictors trained using logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and XGBoost.

We also employ these four predictors in [ToxTeller webserver](https://comics.iis.sinica.edu.tw/ToxTeller).

## Usage
ToxTeller takes a string of sequence file path as the argument.

The sequence file must be in FASTA format, and each sequence should be 10-50 amino acids.

The command is as follows:
```
python toxteller.py [sequence file path]
```

## Output
The output of ToxTeller is a CSV file created in the same folder of the sequence file showing the prediction results. 

Each row represent a peptide sequence with the format:

 Index, peptide name, peptide sequence, sequence length, prediction by LR, prediction by SVM, prediction by RF, prediction by XGBoost
 
The prediction is expressed by 1 (toxic) and 0 (non-toxic).

## Data
The training dataset and independent test dataset are provided in the folder _data_.

The training dataset, where the sequences share similarity smaller than 90%, was used to optimize hyper-parameters and feature combinations in the development stage of ToxTeller.

The independent test set, which consists of sequences sharing similarity smaller than 40% with the training dataset and within itself, was compiled for confirming the effectiveness of the model development process.

The details for compiling the dataset are shown in the figure below.

The trained models (pickle files in _source_code_), also used in ToxTeller webserver, are trained on the whole dataset we collected keeping at most 90% sequence similarity.
